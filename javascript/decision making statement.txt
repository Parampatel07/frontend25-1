decision making statement 
1) statement if (simple decision makeing )
    in program when we want to execute some code only if some condition is true, then we use statement if in program.   
    in if decision making, we check some condition using relational operators (< > <= >= == != === !==)
    if the condition is evaluated as true, then we will execute few line of code. otherwise not. 

    syntax 
    if(condition)
    {
        //line 1 
        //line 2
        ......
    }
    line 10
